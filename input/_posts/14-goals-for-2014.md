Title: 14 Goals for 2014
Lead: 2013 was a great year for me, this may have been partly down to some personal goals I set myself. In 2014 I plan to do the same.

Everyone seems to be writing about their goals and resolutions for the new year. I find goal is a better word than resolution as goals sound more measurable. An a example resolution could go something like 'I must do better at this thing', a goal would be 'I must do this task'. My wife and I have decided to set ourselves 14 goals for 2014, so here are my 7.

## Maintain a Blog

I have had a blog since April 2012 and written 4 blog posts. Writing is not my most favourite task which is why I think I have only written a few posts. So by writing at least one post a month for the next year I hope my writing skills will improve.

## Contribute to an OSS Project

Last year I migrated my blog from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [Sandra.Snow](https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow) (blog post to follow). In that process I made a small [pull request](https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/pull/79) to the Sandra.Snow project, this was also my first contribution to any OSS project. This year I am going to get more involved with an OSS project, whether that is Sandra or some other project that interests me.

## Learn a new Programming Language (or two)

The Pragmatic Programmer says,

>__Learn at least one new language every year.__ Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getter struck in a rut.

And in a step towards being a Polyglot Programmer, I have decided to master the interpreted languages Javascript and Ruby. Both I have used in the past, but I don't have an in depth knowledge of either. My Javascript experience has pretty much been JQuery, Knockout and a smattering of fairly basic functions. When i was "maintaining" my blog in Octopress I picked up a little Ruby, and I started working through the [http://ruby.railstutorial.org](http://ruby.railstutorial.org) sample app.

## Talk at Community Events

With some of the goals and projects I have got planned for this year, I should be able to share my experiences with the community. I am not aiming for conferences such as NDC or any of the DDD events, but more local user groups.

## Finish all my Projects

I have a few half finished side projects, ranging from a face tracking web cam to a budget calculator. This year I will finish them, preferably before I start anything else.

## Get Fit (again)

Since changing jobs and the arrival of my first child, I have hardly been to the gym or out running and have been slowly piling on the pounds.
I am hoping getting fit again wont be much of a challenge as it is something I used to do regularly, so I am going to compete in a race, but not just any race, the <del>10k [Wild Warrior Obstacle Race](http://xrunner.co.uk/events/wild-warrior-obstacle-course-race/)</del> 12 mile [Tough Mudder Obstacle Race](http://toughmudder.co.uk/events/yorkshire-2014/).

## Start Climbing (again)

You would think living in Yorkshire and being a keen climber I would go climbing regularly... No! I left university six years ago and the number of times I have been out climbing since, I could count on one hand.
My goal here is to go climbing at least once a month and before the year is out lead a climb outdoors.

2013 was a great year for me, lets hope 2014 will be just as good for us all.
