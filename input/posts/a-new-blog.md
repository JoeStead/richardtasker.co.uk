Title: A New Blog
Lead: 2013 was a great year for me, this may have been partly down to some personal goals I set myself. In 2014 I plan to do the same.

I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ritasker/status/735359528108187648) today that I had setup a new blog. I have had a blog for the last 4 years and I have only written a handful of articles on subjects that have interested me at the time.

I have moved to from Sandra.Snow to Ghost and basically had all the same problems the Troy Hunt did, so read how he migrated over at [troyhunt.com](https://www.troyhunt.com) [here](https://www.troyhunt.com/its-a-new-blog/) and [here](https://www.troyhunt.com/disqus-and-the-disappearing-comments-which-still-exist/).

From now on my plan is to focus my blog on helping developers build scalable applications for the cloud.

This reinvigoration is partly down to [John Sonmaz's](http://simpleprogrammer.com) email course I have recently worked through. Titled "How to Create a Blog to Boost Your Career" it is a **free** email course. John emails you twice a week for 3 weeks and tells you exactly how to start blogging.

I really recommend the course if you want to start blogging or, like me, have a blog but don't know what to do with it.

Sign up [here](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/) if you are interested. And if I don't write an article for a couple of weeks slam me on twitter or something.
