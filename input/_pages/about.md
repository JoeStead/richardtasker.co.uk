I am Richard Tasker. I am a [programmer](https://github.com/ritasker), Open Source Contributor, and I speak at developer events and user groups.
Originally from Merseyside I now live and work in Leeds, Yorkshire. Predominately a .Net developer I am really interested in building, blogging and speaking about scalable cloud applications and reactive systems. I am keen on following agile practices and use methodologies like TDD, BDD and DDD to get the job done.
When I am not at work I am loving Father and Husband. I enjoy running, rock climbing and bouldering.
